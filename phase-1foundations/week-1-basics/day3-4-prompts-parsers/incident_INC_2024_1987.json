  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "category": "Overnight Batch Job Delay",
  "description": "Overnight batch job processing window exceeded by 4 hours, causing end-of-day reconciliation reports to be delayed from the targeted delivery time of 6 AM to an actual delivery time of 10 AM. No direct customer impact was observed as these reports are used internally only; however, downstream analytics dashboards showed stale data for a period, and the Treasury team's daily liquidity analysis was delayed by 3 hours.",
